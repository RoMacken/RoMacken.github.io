                    <br>I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
                    <br>She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
                    <br>In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
                    <br>Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
                    <br>Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
                    <br>Didn't make sense not to live for fun
                    <br>Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
                    <br>So much to do, so much to see
                    <br>So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
                    <br>You'll never know if you don't go
                    <br>You'll never shine if you don't glow

                    <br>Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
                    <br>And all that glitters is gold
                    <br>Only shooting stars break the mold
                    <br>It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
                    <br>You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
                    <br>But the meteor men beg to differ
                    <br>Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
                    <br>The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
                    <br>The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
                    <br>My world's on fire, how about yours?
                    <br>That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

                    <br>I need to get myself away from this place
                    <br>I said, "Yup" what a concept
                    <br>I could use a little fuel myself
                    <br>And we could all use a little change
